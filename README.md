Boost your ratio in Private Trackers by being an early bird

## How does it work?
Ratiobooster checks the trackers specified in the config file looking for the torrents which meet the seeders, leechers and completed conditions. This way you can choose to only download a torrent when there is a single seed and no one has completed it yet, being able to seed way more than if there were already other seeds.

## Will I get banned? 
Ratiobooster acts as a Web Browser to get the torrent list from the trackers website and relies on your cookie session to perform authentication. This way the tracker can only know that you are accessing the website just as if you were doing it for real. In short, no, it is very unlikely.

In any case, I do not take responsibility for any problems it may cause. Use at your own risk.
